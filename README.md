have deleted ShowHiddenChannels plugin from official BetterDiscord site >:C.

But this plugin still can be found in the commit history of their repository! Proof: (They removed a few lines from the config file that
were needed to plugin's work. Without them it just doesn't work even if you install the previous version from their repository)

I already save it for you, anonymous <3. You just need to download it
and follow the short instructions below.

## Installation ##
1) Download and extract the files.
2) Replace «0BDFDB.data.json» from your plugin folder by «0BDFDB.data.json» downloaded from here (you can also write required lines in this file without replacing).
3) Put «ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js» to your plugin folder.
4) Restart your Discord or just press Ctrl+R
5) ???
6) **Profit!!!**
